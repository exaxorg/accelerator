# Constraints on this data:
#    Each tuple must be the same length.
#    The tests will not work with less than len(tuple) slices.
#    Time values may not have a 0 microsecond, because str() will omit that.
#    No tuple should contain duplicate values (but bool has to).
#    All values must be sortable (within the same tuple).
#       Which means no tuple may contain None, even for types that support None.
#    Numeric types other than int64 must have a low-ish first value.
#    Most of the above doesn't apply to json (because it's handled specially.)
#    complex* are also unsortable. (first value is sortable though.)
# It's supposed to contain all types, but it doesn't really have to.
